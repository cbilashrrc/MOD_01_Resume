# Can I explain what my code does?
# Describe the functionality of your code and its components. How do your code segments work together to meet the project's objectives?

Using basic HTML I was able to build myself a very simple but practical resume. Using what we had learned in the demonstrations I had got the foundations of the website made.

# What was my coding process?
# Reflect on your approach from planning to execution. How did you organize your work, and what strategies did you employ?

I just sat down and started coding. I used the first demonstration alot at first and it was very useful. I came up with some personal ideas I wanted to add that was not shown so I
did my own research and figured out how to employ them into my resume.

# What challenges did I have?
# Identify and describe any obstacles you encountered while working on this project. How did you address or overcome these challenges?

The main challenges were trying to figure out how to get more complex things too work all together. I stayed patient and researched until I figured it out.

# What would I do differently now?
# Given what you have learned through this project, what changes would you make to your approach or your code if you were to start over?

I would change my approach. I just kind of dove in without a plan in mind. It worked for a simple assignment like this one but for future assignments
I will plan accordingly.
